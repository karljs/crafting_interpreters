# Work in Progress

This is a naive implementation of the tree-walk interpreter for Lox
from the first half of the book [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).  I'm porting it to
Rust, chapter-by-chapter, with no foresight, which means that it's not
idiomatic—the book uses Java in the first half—and has a bunch of
custom code for things which is not intended to be production quality.
